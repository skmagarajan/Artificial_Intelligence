## Simple Reflex Agent 
 
This assignment is to build the simple reflex agent in the wumpus world. 
 
#### Changes Made in Agent function 
 
* Added action instance variable. 
 
* Added No operation action in the action table array of index 0. 
 
* If glitter is found, grab it (action 6). 
 
* Check if any percepts are found or not, if not then action is move forward (action 1). 
 
* Else, Check whether breeze or bump is present if so get the random probability. If the random probability is greater than 0.8 then Turn left (or Right - action 5 or 4). Otherwise no operation (action 0). 
 
* Check whether Stench is present if so get the random probability and it is greater than 0.8 shoot the wumpus (action 7) else no operation (action 0). 
 
* If wumpus is killed and scream percept is true then agent can move forward (action 1).
